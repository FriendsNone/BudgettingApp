# TODO

1. Expense tracking: The app should allow users to track their expenses easily and quickly. This could be done by allowing users to categorize their spending, set spending limits, and receive notifications when they reach their limits.
2. Income tracking: The app should also allow users to track their income, including their salary, bonuses, and other sources of income. This will allow users to understand their cash flow and better plan their spending.
3. Budget creation: The app should enable users to create and manage their budgets easily. Users should be able to set limits for different categories of spending, track their progress against their budgets, and adjust their budgets as needed.
4. Bill reminders: The app should allow users to set up reminders for upcoming bills and other recurring expenses. This will help users avoid late fees and other penalties.
5. Goal setting: The app should allow users to set financial goals, such as saving for a down payment on a house or paying off credit card debt. Users should be able to track their progress towards these goals and receive notifications when they achieve them.
6. Customization: The app should allow users to customize the categories they use for tracking expenses and creating budgets, as well as the alerts and notifications they receive.
